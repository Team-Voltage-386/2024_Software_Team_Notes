## Tested Shooter
1. Ryan did some excellent work which allowed control of the demo shooters individual motors. We added to that code adding some additional control including:
* An on/off toggle
* A way to set the speed of both motors at the same time
    * A toggle to invert which motor got the positive signal and which got the negative signal in case of inversion.
    * A toggle to use the single motor controls vs the shared motor controls

### Conclusions
Mechanical took the shooter back for adjustment in design. We aren't satisfied with this prototype's performance.

## Robot tethering
USB A/B worked
