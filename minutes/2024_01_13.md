# Meeting Minutes
January 13, 2024

## Updated Robots
Ryan finished updating all of the robots to the latest version 2024 and all their subcomponents.

## Last year's robot
Ryan has ported last year's robot code to 2024. It now has some swerve issues where the wheels continuously turn on start. He is still debugging why this is occurring.

## Pathplanner
Lucas has been working on Pathplanner. So far he has accomplished:
* He is able to set a path for autonomous mode which is followed fairly accurately. He can chain multiple paths together.

He is still having an issue with the end. The autonomous command does not finish and the wheels are still spinning when the robot comes to the end of the path.

It should be stable enough to work with cameras.

## Mechanical testing: Shooter
Debbie used Ryan's code to run the shooter in its 2nd iteration. Testing results were much better, however at the end of the testing a mechanical piece flew off! Luckily no one was hurt. The mechanical team were able to gather enough information and have taken the shooter back for continued processing.

## Vision
Clara and Daniel did some more research info limelight. Mechnical is working on construction pieces to hold the april tags. Until then, we can mount them on the wall.

Daniel also created a branch for working with the USB camera and hopefully getting a driver camera working.
