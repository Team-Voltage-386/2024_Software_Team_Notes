2. Follow [instructions](https://docs.revrobotics.com/sparkmax/spark-max-client/getting-started-with-the-spark-max-client/updating-device-firmware)

## Updating the Pigeon etc.
1. Installed [Tuner X](https://pro.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/tuner/index.html). Used it to upgrade most of the firmware.
2. The Pigeon 1 that we have only supports v5 of the API. Installed the latest librarys for [v6 and v5](https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Releases/releases) on VS code. Most of the hardware uses v6, it's just the pigeon that needs v5.
