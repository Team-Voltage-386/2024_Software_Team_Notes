## Major Bug in 2024 Driver Station
We encountered a bug that a lot of other people are encountering. The error message is:

`Internal issue with print and error tags`

This results within 2-30 seconds of enabling the robot. The robot then disables itself and it prints this error message. The error message also appeared when starting the driver station and during its use even when not enabled.

Research online reveals other teams encountering this bug as well. They had two suggested temporary solutions:
1. Use the 2023 Driver Station
2. Use a tethered USB connection

We have experimented and found that these solutions both work for now. We will continue to monitor online channels for progress on solving this major bug. Its pervasive nature hopefully will suggest a speedy solution.
